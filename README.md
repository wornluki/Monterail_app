# Tasks

**Task 1: Implement views** (✓)

I was implemented all three views. I used SASS with Burbon and AngularJS for javascript

**Task 2: Make them responsive**

Most views is responsive. I would need a bit more time to make it best I can.

**Task 3: Connect modal to users** (✓)

Connect user to modal works fine. Nothing to say more :)

**Task 4: Use templates** (✓)

Most data is dynamic. A little of data is still static but it will be no problem to make them dynamic. I would need some time to model data. Data is serve from file.

**Task 5: Add pagination and sorting** (✓)

All works fine. I used angular orderBy for sorting and pagination works fine too. For every load more action show 5 more question.

**Task 6: Add search** (✓)

Search is using angular filter. Works fine.

**Task 7: Implement voting** (✓)

Voting system also works fine besides stop voting more than one. I will repair this bug as soon as possible.

**Task 8: Add routing**

Everything works in SPA. Uses UIRouter

# Additional info

You can look into source files on this github repo.

I know some of code need refactoring and I will be refactor that in near future.
